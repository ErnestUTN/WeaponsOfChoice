## Additional Features

You can now choose among your allowed filtered equippables some "priority" equippables. Click on the dropdown to the right of the filter in the dialog menu and choose your top 3 equippables you want your pawn to pay special attention to. You can leave one or two unchosen dropdowns , not problem, the rest of the filtered equippables will be treated as non-prioritized and will similar to apparel in the outfits menu. [Read the Equip Logic for more info]

## Equip logic
The following two propositions governs the logic behind the picking and equipping of the searched weapon:

1- Priority Weapons ignores filters quality and health % -> Means that not only will be the first weapons to search before attempting to search in the non-priority list, but also the pawn completely disregards quality and health % as said. 

3-  A pawn that has equipped a priority weapon in level 2 won't try to search for a weapon in level 1 Priority (lvl 1 > lvl 2 > lvl 3)

## Compatibility
So far, compatible with the same mods as WeaponsAndOutfits. During the week I will integrate BPC (Better Pawn Control) within it
