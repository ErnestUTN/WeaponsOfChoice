# WeaponsOfChoice
A revamped version of WeaponsAndOutfits(By me) . This time the weapons configuration are not part of the apparel outfit system.

## Equip logic
The following two propositions governs the logic behind the picking and equipping of the searched weapon:

1- Priority Weapons ignores filters quality and health % -> Means that not only will be the first weapons to search before attempting to search in the non-priority list, but also the pawn completely disregards quality and health % as said. 

3-  A pawn that has equipped a priority weapon in level 2 won't try to search for a weapon in level 1 Priority (lvl 1 > lvl 2 > lvl 3)

## Compatibility
So far, compatible with the same mods as WeaponsAndOutfits. During the week I will integrate BPC (Better Pawn Control) within it
